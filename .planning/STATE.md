## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use CLI subagents (`cline "prompt" &`), not wait for internal subagent system
- Execution happens in main Cline context (CLI agents are read-only)
- npx installation pattern (consistent with upstream GSD)
- Track upstream GSD for improvements and compatibility
- picocolors over chalk (14x smaller, 2x faster, zero deps) [01-01]
- ESM-only package with Node.js 20+ requirement [01-01]
- Warning instead of error when Cline CLI not found [01-02]
- CLINE_DIR environment variable override for custom config locations [01-02]
- Clean install overwrites existing installation without prompts [01-03]
- Atomic rollback on partial installation failure [01-03]
- Cline workflows use `/gsd-name` format (not `/gsd:name`) [01-03]
- Workflows install to ~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/ with gsd- prefix [01-03]
- Platform-specific spawn: Windows shell:true, Unix detached:true [02-01]
- Return error info instead of throwing on file operations [02-02]
- Mock test mode when Cline CLI unavailable [02-02]
- Templates match upstream GSD section structure exactly [03-01]
- config.json includes full upstream fields (planning, gates, safety) [03-01]
- Only .planning/ and .planning/phases/ created during init [03-01]
- Pure parser / file reader separation for testability [03-02]
- Shallow must_haves parsing (raw text for downstream) [03-02]
- Config defaults merging when config.json missing [03-02]
- Regex-based line replacement for position updates (simpler than section rebuild) [03-03]
- updateStateSection operates on ## level only (### are part of parent) [03-03]
- Self-contained project-init.js (no state-init.js import) to avoid circular deps [04-01]
- Config defaults intentionally duplicated across modules for independence [04-01]
- Workflow supports both Write tool and Node.js helper patterns [04-01]
- 10-step workflow matching upstream GSD new-project flow [04-01]
- Progress workflow reads state files gracefully (missing files noted, not errored) [04-02]
- Smart routing with priority-ordered conditions (blocked > unexecuted > complete > all done) [04-02]
- Integration test pattern: tmpdir isolation, assert/strict, PASS/FAIL, cleanup in finally [04-02]
- Prompts reference agent definition file (not inline instructions) [05-01]
- Confirmation marker files as outputFile for agent spawn tracking [05-01]
- Sequential fallback loops through prompts one-at-a-time when parallelization=false [05-01]
- Workflow handles existing maps with refresh/skip options [05-01]
- Do NOT test runMapping (spawns real processes); test orchestration in isolation [05-02]
- Three pipeline scenarios (full/partial/empty) for comprehensive edge case coverage [05-02]
- CONTEXT.md has exactly 3 sections: Decisions, Claude's Discretion, Deferred Ideas [06-01]
- getOrCreatePhaseDir wraps ensurePhaseDir (single-module import for workflows) [06-01]
- Template returns placeholders, workflow fills values during conversation [06-01]
