## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Use CLI subagents (`cline "prompt" &`), not wait for internal subagent system
- Execution happens in main Cline context (CLI agents are read-only)
- npx installation pattern (consistent with upstream GSD)
- Track upstream GSD for improvements and compatibility
- picocolors over chalk (14x smaller, 2x faster, zero deps) [01-01]
- ESM-only package with Node.js 20+ requirement [01-01]
- Warning instead of error when Cline CLI not found [01-02]
- CLINE_DIR environment variable override for custom config locations [01-02]
- Clean install overwrites existing installation without prompts [01-03]
- Atomic rollback on partial installation failure [01-03]
- Cline workflows use `/gsd-name` format (not `/gsd:name`) [01-03]
- Workflows install to ~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/ with gsd- prefix [01-03]
